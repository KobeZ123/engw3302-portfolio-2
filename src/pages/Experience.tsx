As the technical lead on this project, I work closely with my project lead to scope out how we can ensure a smooth release, and I collaborate alongside fellow developers to implement features improving the user experience of the product.",

I also created documents to centralize understanding of our data fetching pipeline to support the turnaround and onboarding of new developers on a semesterly basis. I am also exploring solutions for user analytics in an effort to gain insights on student needs."
